Our Daycare Management System is a semester project developed using C# and SQL. It offers a user-friendly interface built with WinForms, enabling efficient management of daycare operations. The system facilitates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing children's records, staff details, schedules, and more. While it serves as a basic implementation, it fulfills the requirements of our semester project and provides a foundation for future improvements.

This project was a collaborative effort between Umama Saif and Shajia Tahir. Shajia Tahir's dedication and teamwork were instrumental in delivering a high-quality solution.
